```release-note:enhancement
fleet-terraform-generator: Glob patterns that do not match any package will now trigger an error.
```

```release-note:breaking-change
Removed stale Terraform modules for the ti_abusech package that were for the httpjson input.
This package was rewritten to use the CEL input. So update any module references to use the
new modules for the CEL input.
```
